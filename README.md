# Motion_detection
motion detection using opencv

To test on other videos rather than webcam replace 0 in 
video = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
with path of the video file for example 
video = cv2.VideoCapture("Horses_2.mp4")

The graph.html file represents the plot for no. of times motion is detected along with the duration of motion.
